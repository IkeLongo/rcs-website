            <h3 className="text-xl font-maven-pro mt-6">Financial Incentives</h3>
            <p className="mt-4">“Financial incentive” means a program, benefit, or other offering, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, sharing, or sale of personal information.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">The law permits financial incentives or a price or service difference if it is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. A business must be able to explain how the financial incentive or price or service difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. The explanation must include:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 flex flex-col gap-2">
              <li>a good-faith estimate of the value of the consumer’s data that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference; and</li>
              <li>a description of the method the business used to calculate the value of the consumer’s data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">We may decide to offer a financial incentive (e.g., price or service difference) in exchange for the retention, sale or sharing of a consumer’s personal information.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">If we decide to offer a financial incentive, we will notify you of such financial incentive and explain the price difference, as well as material terms of the financial incentive or price of service difference, including the categories of personal information that are implicated by the financial incentive or price or service difference.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">If you choose to participate in the financial incentive you can withdraw from the financial incentive at any time by emailing us at <a href="mailto:contact@rivercitycreatives.com" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">contact@rivercitycreatives.com</a>, by calling us toll-free at 210-730-6232, by visiting <a href="#dpo-contact-form" className="text-blue-400 hover:underline">our Contact Form</a>, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.</p>
